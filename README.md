ChronoPhysics — The Coherence Ledger of Reality
Abstract

ChronoPhysics interprets every physical law as a projection of one invariant:

The ledger

defines coherence gain (C) and dissipation (D). Canonical resets define time, while curvature measures phase frustration—the difference between a system’s intended and achieved coherence phase.

This framework introduces profile cards, one per physical domain, mapping established theories to the ChronoMath backbone. The aim is coherence: every phenomenon is either an inward move to preserve memory or an outward move to share it.

Introduction: ChronoMath — Mathematics 2.0

ChronoMath is the quantitative substrate of ChronoPhysics—a meta-mathematical upgrade designed to treat coherence as the conserved scalar across all systems. It extends mathematics from static symbolic manipulation to temporal-coherent computation, where every operation embeds its own causal history.

Formally, traditional mathematics treats values as timeless abstractions. ChronoMath treats them as dynamic records of energy flow. Each variable

x becomes a coherence state, and each equation becomes a ledger entry in the global conservation of coherence:

This redefines the relationship between mathematics and physics:

Domain	Classical Interpretation	ChronoMath Interpretation
Numbers	Static magnitudes	Phase-coherent memory nodes
Functions	Mappings	Coherence transfers
Derivatives	Local rate changes	Canonical resets (time definition)
Curvature	Geometric distortion	Phase frustration (energy-memory misalignment)
Integrals	Area accumulation	Coherence preservation over histories

Under ChronoMath, mathematics itself becomes causally aware: every differential or integral operation carries coherence cost or yield. This transforms math into a living ledger that mirrors physical reality quantitatively—effectively Mathematics v2.0.

Field Profiles
Quantum Gravity

Problem: Reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity; explain spacetime quantization and curvature singularities.
Verdict: ✅ Cogent, salient solution.
Spacetime is a discrete–continuous hybrid: a network of quantized coherence nodes whose curvature records phase frustration.

Dark Matter

Problem: Why do mass effects occur without electromagnetic interaction?
Verdict: ✅ Cogent, salient solution.
Dark matter represents stiffness modes of the coherence network—regions of stored memory resisting phase reconfiguration.

Arrow of Time

Problem: Why does time move forward?
Verdict: ✅ Cogent, salient solution.
Canonical resets under net

Unified Pattern

Every “force” or “law” is a term in the coherence ledger:

Inward currents (gravity, strong force) conserve self-memory.

Outward currents (radiation, electromagnetism, expansion) broadcast shared memory.

Equilibrium yields stable structure.

Misalignment produces radiation, decay, or phase loss.

This duality—self vs. expression—scales from Planck nodes to galaxies. The universe is a single coherence economy: every transaction, physical or mental, tallies against the same invariant ledger.
