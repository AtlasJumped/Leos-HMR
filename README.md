# Leo’s Holistic Model of Reality (HMR)

### Overview

**Leo’s Holistic Model of Reality (HMR)** is a unified framework integrating mathematics, physics, biology, and consciousness into a single coherent system. It explores how intelligence structures the universe through recursive laws of coherence, information, and embodiment.

This repository serves as the **master archive** for all formal HMR research papers, beginning with the **Millennium Prize Series**, where each of the seven Millennium Problems is reinterpreted and addressed through the HMR framework.

### 📘 Current Focus: HMR–MILLENNIUM Series

The *Millennium Papers* apply HMR principles to the deepest unsolved problems in mathematics, offering formal arguments and potential resolutions to:

1. **Navier–Stokes Existence & Smoothness**
2. **Riemann Hypothesis**
3. **P vs NP**
4. **Yang–Mills & Mass Gap**
5. **Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**
6. **Hodge Conjecture**
7. **Poincaré Conjecture (Revisited under HMR Geometry)**

Each paper follows the HMR cadence:

> Abstract → Introduction → Axioms/Framework → Theorems → Consequences → Discussion → References → Conclusion

### 🧠 Core Concept

HMR proposes that **intelligence is the organizing principle of the universe**.
From quantum fields to fascia networks, all structures follow an emergent balance between coherence and dissipation—describable through a shared mathematical grammar.
